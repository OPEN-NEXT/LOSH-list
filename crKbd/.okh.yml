function: The Corne is a 40% split mechanical USB general purpose keyboard. It is made up of two halves with 3x6 column staggered keys and 3 thumb keys. It has full RGB backlighting, and is fully programmable using the popular Open Source QMK firmware. The basic design principles are, to have a minimal, ergonomically arranged set of keys that are all reachable by moving a finger by at most a distance of one key in diagonal.
