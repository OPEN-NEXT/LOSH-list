function = "Water is one of the most important aspects of life all over the world, arguably the most important. So it is critical to have a robust infrastructure that can handle the demands of water, whether they be for survival, or agriculture or it's million of other uses. So for this project I build a simple garden hose splitter.  This OSAT is a garden hose splitter that can be used to split water streams from a common garden hose nozel. This splitter can be customized to any desired size, and can be paired with multiples of itself to further increase splitage.\n"
