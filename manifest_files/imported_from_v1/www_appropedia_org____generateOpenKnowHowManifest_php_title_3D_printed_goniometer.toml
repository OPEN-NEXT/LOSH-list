function = "Goniometers are simple devices used to measure the angular range of motion of human limbs. It is common for doctors to monitor the muscular recovery and rehabilitation of a patient using a goniometer. They are not expensive, however they are flimsy and break easily. A 3D printed goniometer can be more durable than a commercial one. Additionally, one may not always have a goniometer handy.\n"
