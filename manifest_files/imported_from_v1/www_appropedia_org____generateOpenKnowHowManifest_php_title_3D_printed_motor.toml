Things lacking from this design that are to be improved upon:  There is a lot of expensive composite materials in this design. This can be cut down to improve cost savings. Being able to build your own at home can cut down on downtime and failures Product is designed for future applications to insert printed magnets. The design is parametric for different pole combinations.\n"
