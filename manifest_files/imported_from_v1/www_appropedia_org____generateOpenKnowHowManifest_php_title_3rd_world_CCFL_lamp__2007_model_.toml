function = "wikipedia:Cold_cathode Cold cathode lamp (CCFL stands for Cold-Cathode-Fluorescent-Lamp). This is a new kind of Fluorescent-lamp that has cold Cathode tubes. Because there is no heat production there is less energy loss. The cathodes are on the outer end on the inside of the CCFL-tube-lamp. This tube-lamp needs very high voltage to work; the inverter-transformer produces this voltage.\n"
