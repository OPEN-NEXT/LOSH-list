In addition to using this dehydrator as an alternative method in preserving vegetable, fruits, and meat, it will promote sustainable practices. This solar dehydrator will not only serve as a tool for preserving and storing foods, it will also be a demonstration. This display is designed for the farmers, share holders, and communities members so that they may witness and apply sustainable and alternative technology to their everyday lives.\nfood dehydrator, solar dehydrator"
