function = "Bob and Cody have modified the off-grid photovoltaic system at the Arcata Educational Farm. The system previously in place consisted of the following components: solar panel, battery, charge controller, wiring, and answering machine. The new system powers a new answering machine as well as a fan for the composting toilet. This system provides a means for shareholders to contact the AEF for the food season. Previously, there was no power being provided to the answering machine and messages could not be left by veteran shareholders or interested shareholders.\n\nenergy generation"
