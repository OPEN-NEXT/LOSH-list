function = "The Arcata Educational Farm was established in 1993 and is located in Bayside Park at 930 Old Arcata Road. The AEF farm functions by allowing members of the public to purchase shares of the farm, thereby enabling shareholders to take home a portion of the farm's vegetables when they are harvested. This method of operation is known as Community Supported Agriculture development or (CSA). The mission of the AEF, according to their Appropedia page, is to increase \"sustainable agriculture awareness and give people in Arcata the ability to gain work experience related to community farming.\" Recently the Arcata Educational Farm has requested that their existing herb spiral be revamped. An herb sprial is a type of herb garden which is constructed to promote drainage of the water away from the plants at the top of the spiral and accumulation of water at the base of the spiral.\n\ngardening"
