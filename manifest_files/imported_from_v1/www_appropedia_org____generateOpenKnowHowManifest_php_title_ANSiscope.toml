function = "== Problem being addressed == Diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DNS) is a common complication of diabetes that affects between 40 and 60 percent of patients (DyAnsys, n.d.). It is a silent killer, which if left untreated can kill within 5 years. There is very little diagnosis of this disease in the developing world.   == Detailed description of the solution == This device is safe, noninvasive, and uses a portable electrocardiogram (ECG) to measure the activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) hence the name ANSiscope.  It detects the percentage of autonomic dysfunction.\n"
