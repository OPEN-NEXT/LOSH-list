function = "== Problem being addressed == Acute and chronic diarrhea causes damage to a child's stomach lining and disrupts their ability to digest essential proteins. Protein energy malnutrition accounts for over half of all children's deaths in resource-limited countries. The current flow controller for IV treatment is difficult to set properly, even for health workers, and can change setting inadvertently with even slight patient movement. This can result in improper and variable administration of drugs over time.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Acuset IV flow controller monitors drug delivery by rotation of a dial to the intended setting.\n"
