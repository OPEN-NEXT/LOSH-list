function = "Normally PCB Heated Bed draws about 10 amps of current. We need a lot of power and a big power supply for that, which is a big problem in 3-D Printing. Sometimes we are printing only small parts, so we don't need the whole bed heated up. This is what i am trying to do, so we don't need the whole bed heated up when printing something small. I am making an adjustable heated bed that we could adjust to heat only the parts that we want to print on.\n"
