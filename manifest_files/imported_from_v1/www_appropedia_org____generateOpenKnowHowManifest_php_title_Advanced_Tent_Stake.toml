function = "This is a twisted tent stake designed for use in more challenging soil types. Because of its twisted design it is a little harder to install but has been found to have a holding force in a dead pull (parallel to the stake) that is greater than that of a traditional tent stake properly inserted and loaded (at an angle to the stake) for some soil types including partially frozen ground. These tent stakes are light and print easily and their superior holding force compared to normal stakes makes them a go to for tents when the soil doesn't hold traditional stakes in well. Additionally because of their customizable nature they can be easily adapted for any range of applications or soil types. This may be especially applicable to refugee camps where the soil conditions can deteriorate rapidly or be unfavorable to begin with but a good stake is a necessity for providing shelter.\n"
