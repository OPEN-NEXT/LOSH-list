function = "I made this still to determine the cost inputs and energy outputs of small scale ethanol production from local and conventional sources. I used this still to compare the costs and efficiencies of ethanol from organic sugar beets versus refined cane sugar.   == Building the Still ==  There are many different types of ethanol stills that output a variety of alcohol percentages. I choose a still design that is capable of making high percent alcohol which requires less dehydration before being used as a fuel. An ethanol still heats the mash to the boiling point of ethanol 78.5 oC. The ethanol vaporizes out of the mash mixture leaving behind water and solids.\n"
