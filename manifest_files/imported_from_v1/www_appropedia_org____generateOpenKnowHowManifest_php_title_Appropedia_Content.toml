This page describes the most common types of resources that we welcome, as well as their use cases.   == General goal of content on Appropedia ==  Our community does not describe Appropedia as an encyclopedia, but as a compendium of knowledge to solve planetary problems, mostly from a human-centered perspective: poverty, climate change, conservation, health, education, etc. Appropedia focuses mostly on open know-how, which means that knowledge documented tries to help people and organizations understand, study and reproduce actions, to create an effect in their immediate environment.   == Page types on Appropedia == Appropedia can also be described as a library of technical knowledge, and as such, is varied and used in different ways."
