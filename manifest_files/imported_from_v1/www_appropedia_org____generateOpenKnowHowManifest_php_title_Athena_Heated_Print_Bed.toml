function = "A heated print bed has multiple advantages. The biggest advantage of a heated print bed is the ability to print higher temperature materials and do so without warping. even many lower temperature materials will benefit from e heated print bed and see reduced warping. AS heated print bed also has the advantage of being able to use a surface like PEI (polyetherimide) to print onto. This material is great because when heated it will adhere very well to many of the commonly printed plastics (PLA, ABS, PET, Nylon).\n"
