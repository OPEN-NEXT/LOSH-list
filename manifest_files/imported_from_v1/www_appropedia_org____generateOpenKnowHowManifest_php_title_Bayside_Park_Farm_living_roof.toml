function = "Humboldt State University Engineering 305 class volunteered to construct a living roof for Bayside Park Farm a community farm in Arcata, California. The roof was designed to be placed on top of an animal hutch that the farm was currently in the process of building. The type of living roof is considered to be a form of an extensive living roof, due to the fact that it allows for low maintenance and ease of construction. Currently, the living roof seems to be serving its purpose as a roof for the animal hutch.   == Background == Bayside Park Farm located in Arcata California in Northern California in the United States and also goes by the name Arcata Educational Farm.\n"
