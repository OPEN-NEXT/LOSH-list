function = "Monetary and supply aid efforts to third work countries offer a temporary solution to permanent problems. In an effort to provide a sustainable means of income and food, I turned to a now common hobby, beekeeping. Beekeeping provides a source of food to the owner as well as a product which they can sell as a means of income. The difficulty in this hobby is that it is difficult to find the proper resources for a reasonable price. One of those essential resources is a queen rearing kit which allows the owner to properly breed more queeens to maintain their hive.\n"
