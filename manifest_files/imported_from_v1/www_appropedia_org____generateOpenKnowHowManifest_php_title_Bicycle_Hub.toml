function = "The use of 3D printing in developing countries to replace broken or warn parts is greatly beneficial. The low cost printing can be difference between having a mode of transportation or walking. By printing bicycle parts the need to buy new parts will be eliminated. I have printed a bicycle hub using PLA as a prototype for a simple road bike hub. This model uses loose ball bearings which are not as ideal as sealed cartridge bearings when used with PLA. For future designs a sealed cartridge bearing should be used.\n"
