The word cobb comes from an old English root meaning a lump or rounded mass (from www.cobcottage.com)\"Cob\" is also an english term meaning mud building, which uses no forms, no bricks and no wooden structures. Cobb building uses hands and feet to mix a ratio of river sand, clay and straw. This mixture is then formed into cobb balls for uses similiar to sculpting with clay.\n\nrecreational"
