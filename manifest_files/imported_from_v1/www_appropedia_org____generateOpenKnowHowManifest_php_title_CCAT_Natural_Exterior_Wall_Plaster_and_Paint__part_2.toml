function = "== Construction ==   === Prep Work === The first task in actually finishing the wall was to prepare it to be coated. Here again Pennelys Goodshield provided expert advice, performing an inspection and informing me that the wattle and daub section of the wall needed to be filed in with more cob. Cob might be a more exacting mixture in certain circumstances but for our purposes the cob recipe was simply to smother a handful of straw in a heavier than normal clay slip [Recipe for clay slip under Appendix I: Important Recipes.]. First moisten the surface to be coated with water to prevent it from sucking moisture out of the cob, increasing the likelihood of cracking. Then, a handful at a time one shoves the cob into any loose or open spots in the wall."
