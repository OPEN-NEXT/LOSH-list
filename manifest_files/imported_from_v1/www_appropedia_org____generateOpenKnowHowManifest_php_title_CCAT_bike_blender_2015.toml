function = "The CCAT Bike Blender 2015 was constructed as a class project by students of Humboldt State University's Engineering 305: Appropriate Technology class. It is a mechanical, interchangeable design that can be mounted on many different bicycles, rather than being permanently attached to one stationary bike. This bike blender works by using the rotation of the bicycle's rear wheel to turn a vertical shaft which rotates the blender blades. It works very well for making smoothies and is relatively simple to construct.   == Background == Students Bryce Goldstein Goldstein and Carley Bramhill designed and built a bicycle-powered blender to be used and displayed at CCAT, located at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, United States of America.\n"
