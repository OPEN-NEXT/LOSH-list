function = "The word cob comes from an Old English root meaning \"a lump or rounded mass\". Cob is an ancient building material that is composed of sand, earth high in clay, straw, and water. These materials are mixed together by hands and feet to form a mud. When dry, cob is nearly as hard as concrete and has a high durability. This mixture can be used to construct benches, tables, cottages, and even houses.\n"
