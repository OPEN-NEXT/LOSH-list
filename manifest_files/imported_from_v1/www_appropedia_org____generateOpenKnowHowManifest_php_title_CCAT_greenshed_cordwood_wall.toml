function = "CCAT is building a tool shed with green methods in mind so it is called the green shed. Part of this green design is the walls that will be made from as many natural or recycled materials as is reasonable. This project offers students the opportunity to get hands-on experience with various wall infill methods and materials.   == Project Background == The concrete foundation of the green shed was poured to make a standard 6-inch wide wall. This is not wide enough for most earth-building methods to be of much insulation value."
