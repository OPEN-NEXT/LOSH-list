function = "This is the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) manual for CCAT greenshed cordwood wall. Please refer to it and keep it up to date with any O&M changes.   == Summary == The CCAT cordwood wall was constructed using primarily cedar logs and cement mortar. While mortars are very rigid and static once they are set, cordwood tends to change shape, shrinking as it dries. This may cause the wood to separate from the mortar leaving gaps as well as cracks in the wood."
