function = "Another CCAT project brought to you by an HSU student. The Campus Center for Appropriate Technology (CCAT) at Humboldt State University was in the process of reconstruction for several years (2004-2007). With reconstruction drawing to an end and plans for moving back into the new old Buck House finalizing, many efforts at finishing touches have begun. The downstairs of CCAT will be a completely public space, with an ADA accessible bathroom, office space, a possible art gallery, living space, a composting room, a mechanical room, and access to the future attached greenhouse. The floor downstairs was bare concrete, poured by Beacom Construction earlier in the construction process, with a radiant heat system."
