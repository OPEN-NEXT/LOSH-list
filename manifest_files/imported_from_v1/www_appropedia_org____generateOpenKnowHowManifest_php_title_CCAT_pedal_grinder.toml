function = "Bart Orlando demonstrates the pedal powered grinder which he designed and built with the assistance of HSU appropriate technology students. An exercise bike is substituted for the electric motor. A fanbelt is wrapped around the outer circumference of the flywheel of the exercise bike and around a pulley mounted on the same drive shaft that the grinding stone and wire brush are mounted. The shaft is supported by two bearing assemblies. A 24 inch wheel rim is welded to the outer circumference of the flywheel in order to keep the belt on track."
