function = "Bart Orlando and Kati McGuire first demonstrated the use of a pedal powered electric sewing machine at CCAT in 2003 while sewing the net for a prototype of an indoor home insect net ... a non-violent alternative to fly swatters. The same pedal powered electric generator that runs the electric blender was used in the experiment. The generator is a 1/3hp, PM motor which can be geared to produce 110v dc while pedaling at about 90 rpm. So, it seems that some sewing machines are built using universal motors which run on both ac or dc."
