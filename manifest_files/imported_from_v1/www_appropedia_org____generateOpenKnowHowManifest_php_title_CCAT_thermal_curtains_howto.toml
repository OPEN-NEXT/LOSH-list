function = "Why Use Thermal Curtains? In most homes, windows are the single largest avenues of heat loss. Glass is a very poor insulator, having an R-value of 1 (for single panes). Older windows can loose heat where the seal is degraded around the frame. Typical curtains alone provide little insulation from the cold outside, but using thermal curtains can increase the insulative value of your windows by up to 7 times (R-value of 7), keeping more heat in your home."
