function = "The yurt at CCAT, as pictured above, differs in design from both traditional and imported styles of yurts. The most notable differences are that the walls are made out of plywood board and the roof is covered in wood shingles. Also, on the inside, there is a bench built into the wall that circumscribes the entire floor. This yurt was built to be a permanent structure and is used on campus for a gathering place. Please see CCATâ€™s webpage and take the virtual tour for more pictures of the yurt.\n"
