Please refer to it regularly and keep it up to date with any O&M changes.   == Operation ==  The operation of the CCAT yurt is straightforward when all components have been well maintained. There is little that needs to be done in order for the retaining wall, roof, and Liter-of-Lights to operate. However, the photovoltaic system does require some further explanation."
