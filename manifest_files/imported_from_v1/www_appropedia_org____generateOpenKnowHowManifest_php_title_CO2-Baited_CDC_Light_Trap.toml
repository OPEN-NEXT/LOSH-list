function = "== Problem being addressed == Many mosquitos in tropical and subtropical regions carry protists that cause malaria in humans.  The mosquitos are abundant in these regions because of the optimal climate. Hence, there is a need to control mosquitosâ€™ habitat to prevent malaria spread.   == Detailed description of the solution == Since mosquitos are attracted to light sources as well as CO2, they are drawn in to the CO2-baited CDC light traps.  Reducing the number of mosquitos near houses and villages will help prevent bites that could cause malaria."
