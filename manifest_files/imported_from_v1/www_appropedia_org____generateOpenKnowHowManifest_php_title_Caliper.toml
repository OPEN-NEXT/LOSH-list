function = "Calipers are a useful tool because they provide a bit more accuracy than a standard ruler. This design is 3D printable, and can be modified to change the length, and increment size. It is nowhere as accurate as a digital caliper. But it helps to get rough measurements   == Bill of Materials == PLA Superglue   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == Knowledge of how use openSCAD to modify the length and increment size of the caliper   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Parts are on on this YouMagine link https://www.youmagine.com/designs/caliper#documents Print the ruler model either flat on its back or on its side opposite of the increment marks. Print the caliper pieces on either of their sides Print both left and right caliper pieces and end cap together to prevent warping.\n"
