Foundries use 3D printed model to begin prototype molds to ensure that molten metal fills and create the specific casts that they desire.      == Skills and Knowledge Necessary to Make the Cast Iron Pan == 3D printing Capability, Metal Casting Experience, of Sand Molds and Gray Iron Chemistry, Grinding   == Bill of Materials == All 3D models can be found here (STLs, OpenSource CAD models) Note: Pieces were printed separately and glued together Wood Glue - Estimated cost $4 Foundry Access - Sand Molding, Molten Metal (Gray Iron for Cast Iron Pan), Grinder for optimal smooth cooking surface  \tCast Iron Pan Mold \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t  Some steps are a secret of the foundry! Good Luck molding! Be Safe!\n"
