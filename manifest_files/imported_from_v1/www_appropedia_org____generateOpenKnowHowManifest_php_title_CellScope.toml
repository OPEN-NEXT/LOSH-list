function = "== Problem being addressed == Malaria is a global health threat that threatens over 2 billion people worldwide. Low-cost, effective, and easy-to-use devices empower affected and at-risk communities with novel solutions to respond to malaria.    == Detailed description of the solution == Light microscopy is one diagnostic method to address malaria. However, rural and developing regions may not have access to microscopy equipment or trained individuals to use the equipment to provide diagnostic feedback.  CellScope is a technology that mounts a light microscope to cell phones."
