function = "== Problem being addressed == Cervical cancer is the leading cause of womenâ€™s death in developing countries. The Western Journal of Medicine estimates that it causes about 190,000 deaths per year. This is largely in part to the lack of early detection of the condition and therefore, lack of preventative measures.   == Detailed description of the solution == This portable colposcope is a cervical cancer screening device that allows up to 8X magnified visual inspection of the cervix. The doctor applies acetic acid to the cervix to expose precancerous lesions, turning them white."
