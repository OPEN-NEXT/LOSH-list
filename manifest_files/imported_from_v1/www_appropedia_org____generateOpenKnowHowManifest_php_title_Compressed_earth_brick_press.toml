CCAT, the campus center for appropriate technology, has recently relocated and their new grounds have many uncontrolled hillsides. With general erosion problems and hazards posed by downhill water flow over clay, the need for retaining walls is immediate.   == Literature Review ==   === Compressed Earth Brick (CEB) basics === Compressed earth bricks are building blocks formed from stabilized or un-stabilized compressed earth.\nconstruction"
