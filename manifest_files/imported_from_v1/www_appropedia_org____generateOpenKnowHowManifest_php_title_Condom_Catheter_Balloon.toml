PPH (Postpartum hemorrhaging) rates in the developed worlds have severely decreased, but they are still a great threat in developing countries. The World Health Organization suggests that there are over 100,000 deaths due to postpartum hemorrhaging every year.    == Detailed description of the solution == A rubber catheter is used to insert a normal condom into the uterus. It is then inflated with 250-300 ml of isotonic saline solution until the bleeding is controlled."
