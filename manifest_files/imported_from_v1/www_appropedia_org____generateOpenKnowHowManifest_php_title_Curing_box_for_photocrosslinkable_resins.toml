This is because the LED strips ordered on eBay will not arrive until in November or early December 2017.   == Designer == Kasper Dienel Aalto University, Research Group of Polymer Technology   == Project == This page describes how you can build a Curing box for photocrosslinkable resins. Such curing boxes are mainly used for after the curing of stereolithography builds."
