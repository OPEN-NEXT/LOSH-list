function = "This 10 week project is a combination of social service and a comprehensive experience with natural building. The final goal of this project was to provide a refuge for homeless senior citizens within the compound of the Parras Desarollo Integral de la Familia (DIF) so that they can find shelter and companionship, as integration of the family and community is an important part of the Parras culture. DIF is a nation-wide government organization based in Mexico City. They are a social service organization providing communities with essentials such as childcare services, food drives, public education concerning etiquette, proper nutrition, child rearing, etc. while creating a community center and support network for those who need it."
