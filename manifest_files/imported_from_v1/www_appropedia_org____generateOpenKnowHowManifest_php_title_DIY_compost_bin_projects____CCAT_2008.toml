function = "Compost is a mixture of decaying organic materials (plants) that is used for to fertilize and condition land . Compost can be anything from a pile of sticks and brush to food scrap bins using worms to digest organic materials (vermiculture). The main purpose of compost is to recycle food and garden wastes in to fertile soil.   === Nature recycles the Essentials of life === As plants grow, huge amounts of organic materials are spread across landscapes in the form of leaves, needles, branches, and other leafy matter. These \"dead\" materials are broken down by an armada of bacteria, fungi, insects, birds and animals to produce topsoil.\n"
