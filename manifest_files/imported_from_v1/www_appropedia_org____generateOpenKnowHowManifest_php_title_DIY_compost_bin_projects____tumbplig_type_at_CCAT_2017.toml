Using readily available building materials one can construct their own tumbling composter to utilize at their homes, which this product will fit perfectly, especially at homes with limited space and like the cleaner appearance of a tumbler as opposed to a heap of steaming compost!. With increased aeration comes a speedier composting process, meaning more nutrient rich soil for your own personal use.   = Background = For the Spring 2017 semester, we are rebuilding the Humboldt State University compost system at CCAT (the Campus Center for Appropriate Technology). CCAT is a model home dedicated to demonstrating renewable and carbon neutral practices you can do in your home.\n"
