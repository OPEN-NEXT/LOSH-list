function = "A simple homebuilt drag harrow using modern S-tines and a cage roller. This unit was sized for use by a team of small donkeys. The goal was to efficiently utilize the limited draft power in a unit that was easy to build and maneuverable in small spaces. My initial impetus was to make a drag that was light enough for my miniature donkeys to handle. The team had experience with ordinary 3' drag harrows, the kind with 8 teeth arranged in 3 rows, with a rotating mechanism that controls the depth."
