function = "This is a payload attachment for the DJI Phantom 3 quadcopter. Unlike other payload attachments, this does not require the removal of the camera gimbal. This design may be useful in search and rescue operations. The camera on the quadcopter can be used to spot the missing person. The quadcopter could then land, and deliver emergency supplies, a GPS tracker, or a radio to the victim."
