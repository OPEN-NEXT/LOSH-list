function = "The most famous and most successful solar solar concentration system in the world is the Scheffler solar kitchen. They are great because the cooking or heat storage container is stationary and only the reflective dish moves. This is because the reflector and the target are on the axis of rotation on equatorial mount. This also reduces \"tracking\" costs hugely because the reflector just has to rotate at 15 degrees per hour and it will keep the reflected light on the target all day. To account for seasonal changes in in the path of the sun the reflector must change shape depending on the time of year."
