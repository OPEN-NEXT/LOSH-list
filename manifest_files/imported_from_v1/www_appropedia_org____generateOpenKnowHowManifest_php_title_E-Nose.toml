function = "== Problem being addressed == Tuberculosis (TB) is a common and potentially lethal infectious disease caused by various strains of mycobacteria, usually Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB kills close to 1.7 million people globally every year and is highly contagious, and is primarily spread through airborne transmission.  When infected people cough, sneeze, talk or spit, they propel TB germs, known as bacilli, into the air. A person needs only to inhale a small number of these to be infected. Left untreated, each person with active TB can infect on average between 10 and 15 people every year."
