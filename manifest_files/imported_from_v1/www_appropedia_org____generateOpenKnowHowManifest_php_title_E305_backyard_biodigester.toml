function = "The objective of our project is to take organic waste including dog, cow, and horse excrement, as well as kitchen waste and recycle it. Methane is a harmful greenhouse gas that can potentially be harnessed as a clean-burning renewable fuel. Convert organic household waste and feces into methane. This project was started with cow manure and biodigested sludge from our local municipality's anaerobic digester to create a small-scale anaerobic digester for the backyard. The process by which organic materials breakdown creates a flammable gas."
