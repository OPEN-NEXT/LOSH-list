function = "Monitoring energy consumption can motivate consumers to save energy by reducing waste. As a Green IT Energy Conservation Measure, the scope of this monitoring is limited to electricity, however similar systems can be used to monitor and reduce gas and water consumption. The consumption of electricity changes the environment. Examples of physical changes required to produce electricity are power stations, pipelines, tree felling and dam construction. In addition to the direct physical impact, these things produce emissions such as carbon dioxide and other waste gases that are released into the atmosphere."
