function = "== Problem being addressed == Sepsis arises when the bodyâ€™s response to an infection damages its own tissues and organs. In low-resource settings, it accounts for 60-80% of all deaths. Due to underspecified symptoms, subtle symptoms, and rapid deterioration of tissue, sepsis is often diagnosed too late, and therefore treated too late.   == Detailed description of the solution == This portable, non-perishable device uses fluorescence to rapidly detect a key early biomarker for sepsis, procalcitonin (PCT). Its sensors will be cheap and it will be easy to use by health care workers and parents at home."
