function = "During the summer of 2008 we, Desiree Woods and Angela Swigart, created a small organic garden at a local kindergarten and daycare center named \"Nuevo Sol\" in Parras, Mexico. Nuevo Sol has been serving the Parras community for 16 years, and for the first years of its life was the only public kindergarten/daycare center in Parras. Nuevo Sol is administered by Se√±ora Sofia Garcia Dominguez, and works with children aged 2 months to 10 years. It is a year-round school, however the majority of students attend during the regular school year. Nuevo Sol primarily serves single parent homes or low income families, and acts as a place where parents can drop off their children while they go to work."
