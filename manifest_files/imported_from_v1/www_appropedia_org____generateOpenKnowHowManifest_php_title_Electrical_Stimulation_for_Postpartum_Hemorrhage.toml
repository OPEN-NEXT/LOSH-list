function = "== Problem being addressed == Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality. PPH, characterized as greater than 500 mL of blood lost in 24 hours, contributes to a large portion of the worldâ€™s 340,000 maternal deaths each year.    == Detailed description of the solution == The device is a compact battery-powered device that generates electrical signals to respond to conditions uterine atony (i.e. loss of strength of the uterus).
