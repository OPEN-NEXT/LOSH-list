function = "Internet-related electricity consumption is rising rapidly as global Internet users spend more than 6.5 h per day online. Open source ad blockers can reduce the time and thus electricity spent using computers by eliminating ads during Internet browsing and video streaming. In this study, three open-source ad blockers are tested against a no-ad blocker control. Page load time is recorded for browsing a representative selection of the globally most-accessed websites. The time spent watching ads on videos is quantified for both trending and non-trending content."
