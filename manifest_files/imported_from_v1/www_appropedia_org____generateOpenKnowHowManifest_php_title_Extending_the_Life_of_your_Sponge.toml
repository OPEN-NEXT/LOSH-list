Third, fill a pot with about five cups of water, bring to a boil and drop your sponge(s) into the boiling water. Set the timer for about twenty minutes so you dont forget about your sponge(s). After twenty minutes pour out the water and if the sponge(s) still have a bad odor you can repeat the boiling process until they are up to par.\n"
