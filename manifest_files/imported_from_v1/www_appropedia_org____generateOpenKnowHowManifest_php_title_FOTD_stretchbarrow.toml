function = "The Stretchbarrow is a device designed to carry beach grass. It was created for the Friends of the Dunes organization as a method of hauling invasive beach grass after it has been removed. The stretcher-wheelbarrow design was created by a group of students from Humboldt State University's Engr215 Introduction to Design class.   == Background == The goal of the Friends of the Dunes is to conserve the natural diversity of coastal environments. In order to effectively do this, volunteers systematically remove the invasive beach grass from the dunes in Arcata, CA. The Stretchbarrow was designed to transport the removed beach grass from the Humboldt Coastal Nature Center to awaiting vehicles for offsite disposal."
