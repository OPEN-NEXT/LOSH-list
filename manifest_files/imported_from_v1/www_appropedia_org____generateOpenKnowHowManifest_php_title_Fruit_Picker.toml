function = "This project is made for people who wish to pick unreachable fruit from trees. Forcing fruit out of a tree causes it to bruise and spoil quicker than that that is picked from with care. The fruit picker is printed in two parts. It uses a regular 2 liter soda bottle along with five screws to assemble. It does also require an old broom handle or piece of pipe to use as a handle."
