function = "The corner restraint is a simple design that can be easily changed through it's FreeCAD file and it is designed to be printed without the use of support material to save plastic. When trying to safely transport material, this tool would be very useful and cost-efficient for those who would need it. I didn't find case studies where the technology is being used successfully.   == Bill of Materials == - Materials needed for fabrication of the device, prices/sources of non-printable parts  1/8 in. x 1/4 in."
