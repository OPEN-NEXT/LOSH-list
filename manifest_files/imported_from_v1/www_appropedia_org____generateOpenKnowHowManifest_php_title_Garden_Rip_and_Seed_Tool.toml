function = "This project was originally intended for the developing world to aid in farming and rapid planting. In america we have our large commercial sized farm equipment that can plow, plant, seed and harvest at incredible rates. While this design comes no where close to those production levels it can aid in planting a garden by removing the need to first dig a hole and then place a seed into the hole. Now a planter can simply fill the hopper with seeds and plant a long line in a matter of seconds.   == Bill of Materials == About 100 grams of any PLA Filament or similar filament  1 Medium size and duty rubber band."
