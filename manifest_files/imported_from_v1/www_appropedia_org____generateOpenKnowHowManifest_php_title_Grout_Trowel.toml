function = "When spreading grout for tiling in areas like the kitchen or bathroom a normal tool may prove to be to large and unwieldy. My landlord asked for a cheap 3D printable tool that could fufill three tasks. The first main taks and what this tool is made for is spreading grout for tiling. However there are two other functions that you can use this for: smoothing concrete, and spackling. Those secondary applications won't work as well as a dedicated tool but this tool can still perform them."
