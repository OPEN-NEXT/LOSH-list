function = "Grow your school is a proyect created in 2017 by architecture studio Cincopatasalgato and engineering firm JEP Ingenieros for non-governmental organizations Central America Foundation for Rural Education Development (CAFRED) and ConTextos. It consists of a design proposal for a sustainably built school located in Caserío El Quebracho in Jujutla, department of Ahuachapán, El Salvador. The proposed construction area is 877.62 m2, with a potential impact on 400 direct beneficiaries.   == Background == In the innermost areas of El Salvador, school buildings are vital to communities as they are often underutilized in the afternoon and serve as meeting place for various purposes. Bamboo and other raw materials are also commonly found in rural areas, which locals have used as construction resources for decades, both as a way to honor ancient practices and as a solution in the face of poverty.\nEducation, Architecture"
