function = "The Energy Monitoring station at Humboldt State University (HSU) in California , started in December 2008 where one of the many projects under the Humboldt Energy Independence Fund (HEIF). This on-going project is responsible for collecting, analyzing and publishing specific energy usage for campus and community use. The idea was created after a program that was similar to UC Davis' energy monitoring system, where their information is about specific building energy usage. This information has a variety of uses which may result in less electricity use by Humboldt State University. Previously the information was thought that the electric and gas meters installed throughout the campus were not monitored by any outside sources."
