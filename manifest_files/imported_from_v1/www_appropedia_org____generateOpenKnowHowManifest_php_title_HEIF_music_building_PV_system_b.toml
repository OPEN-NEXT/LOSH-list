function = "The Humboldt Energy Independence Fund (HEIF) received a proposal written by the Renewable Energy Student Union (RESU) in the spring of 2008 for the installation of a photovoltaic system upon the roof of the old music building at Humboldt State University. HEIF is a committee which determines the allocation of money toward projects aiming to reduce Humboldt State University's dependence upon external energy sources. HEIF's proposal for the photovoltaic system was written entirely by Environmental Resource Engineering students who collaborated with RESU. The proposal offers 3 options of varying cost and size; the suggested sizes of the system are 3.5 kW, 5.3 kW, 10.6 kW. This is the first proposal to the HEIF committee which included a stipulation requiring the implementation of student labor; a certain amount of the money given to the contractor for the installation was to be allocated for hiring student workers (Figure 1).   == Purpose of Installing the Panels == The purpose of installing a photovoltaic system on the music building was to reduce the amount of on campus energy generated by fossil fuels as well as reduce energy cost, to demonstrate that small PV systems are practical, and to educate people on the use of photovoltaic systems. The system harnesses enough energy from the sun to accommodate most of the energy expenses from the building with more than is needed on sunny days.\nEnergy"
