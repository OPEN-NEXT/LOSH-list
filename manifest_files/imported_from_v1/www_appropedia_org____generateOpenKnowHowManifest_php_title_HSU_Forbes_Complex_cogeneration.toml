Forbes Physical Education Complex, located on the Humboldt State University, HSU, campus in Arcata California.   == Background ==   === Forbes Complex ===  The Forbes Complex, Figure 2, was first built in 1973. The building was originally constructed to produce coaches and PE teachers. 30 years have passed since the construction of the Forbes Complex, and priorities have changed since the 70's. The Forbes Complex needed to be remodeled to meet new concerns such as the need for new types of physical education, and to reduce energy consumption levels in the Forbes Complex."
