function = "Folks on the ground can look at local needs and resources. Appropedia can help by providing links to specific technologies, \"appropriate\" in the sense that they can be built with local resources and other resources that may be brought in with relative ease, and used to help with local needs. We can all expect to learn as we go along. This page was initially based on Haiti earthquake assistance project by Bart Orlando, and later revamped by Lucas Gonzalez using the SCIM (simple critical infrastructure mapping) framework developed by Vinay Gupta et al, and detailed also in a STARâ€“TIDES and Starfish Networks: Supporting Stressed Populations with Distributed Talent (#70 of Defense Horizons). Please give us some time to flesh it out a bit, and comment in the talk page."
