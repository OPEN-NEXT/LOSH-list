function = "This Hand Pump Drill is a mechanical drill that utilizes human effort to perform the functions of a drill. In locations where power tools are too expensive or there is little access to electricity, a hand drill is an effective solution. 3D printing these means they can be very cost efficient - less than $0.25 in filament, a spring, and drill bits.  \t\t \t\t \t\t   == Bill of Materials == Materials Needed: Drill Bit(s) of varying sizes - any standard drill bits should fit this drill. (OPTIONAL) Spring to have spring-loaded capabilities: Purchase here STLs and Open-Source (Blender) Source Files Download   == Tools needed == Jellybox or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == This print should take about 4 hours (I printed three different prints - one with 3 pieces, one with 2, and one with 1)."
