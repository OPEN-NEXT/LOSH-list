function = "This project is designed so that it could be used for tracking the sun light and convert it to electrical power using the solar panel. I have very simple designs without curves and complexity. Integration is simple. Principal behind the working is simple. I have used simple photo resistors to track the sun light which are placed in the same plane of the solar panel to get maximum power output."
