function = "I wanted to implement my own at-home kid-friendly 3 bin composting system.The objective of this project is to make a small-scale at home composting system that will be easy, low-cost, instructive, and educational to children while diverting food waste and other compostable materials from the landfill. There is virtually no construction involved in this project. Using this system is very easy and relatively maintenance free. The microbes in the compost are doing most of the work! Our family has really enjoyed this composting project it was fun and educational."
