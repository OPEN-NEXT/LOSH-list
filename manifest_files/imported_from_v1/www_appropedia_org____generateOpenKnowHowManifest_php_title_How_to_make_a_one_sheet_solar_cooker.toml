function = "Cocina Solar Simple in Spanish / en espa√±ol.  http://imagina-canarias.blogspot.com/2008/06/cocina-solar-simple.html 9 june 2008 This is the simplest solar cooker I've been able to design:  Use a cardboard sheet 60 cm x 80 cm or larger. Draw lines to divide in 2x3 parts, and cut \"A\" lines only. The dotted lines are all for concave folding, so you can make a careful \"half-cut\" and then it will be easier to fold. Make two holes, so that the string will go through the holes once the red parts are below the yellow part."
