function = "When we first took on this project, we had three different design opportunities to consider and we were overwhelmed to say the least. But luckily for us, we had help from Bart Orlando, a local expert on solar cookers. The first design we considered was using a recycled radar dish as a frame, the second was a portable parabolic cooker with a collapsible frame, and the third was using a recycled papasan chair as a frame. We were looking at using a recycled chair or radar dish because of there inherent parabolic shape already. Once we decided that our most feasible design would be the Papasan Chair, we had to next decide what kind of reflective surface to cover the chair with."
