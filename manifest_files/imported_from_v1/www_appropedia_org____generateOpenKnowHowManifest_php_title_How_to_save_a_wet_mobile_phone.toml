function = "You can often save your wet mobile phone (cell phone) if you act quickly. So after you salvage it from the sink, or from the table after a spilled drink, follow these steps immediately:  Quickly wipe off the surface moisture Remove battery. (If it's an iPhone, the battery can't be removed, but at least make sure your iPhone is off and locked). Remove the SIM card if it has one, dry it carefully and put it somewhere safe (and where you'll remember it). At least the data there is safe."
