function = "Many companies are currently researching and developing hydrogen cars. Funding has come from both private and government sources. Development is largely the result of interests in limiting the environmental impact of automobiles, as the only emissions of fuel cells vehicles is water. As long as the hydrogen is prepared without the use of fossil fuel input, the propulsion of a fuel cell automobile will have no contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrogen fuel cell cars also travel farther on a given volume of fuel than their gasoline powers counter parts."
