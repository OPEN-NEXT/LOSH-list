function = "== Problem being addressed == Women in developing nations often do not have access to contraceptives, and in the case that they do, may find it difficult to adhere to tedious guidelines on a regular basis. Essentially, there is a need for easy-to-use, cost-effective contraceptives that do not require regular maintenance or effort.   == Detailed description of the solution == This innovative drug delivery system is a subcutaneous biosynthetic bone-like material made of calcium minerals that, once implanted, can deliver contraceptives at regular intervals in a sustained manner for several months.   == Designed by == Designed by: This device is currently being developed by GÃ©rrard Poinern of Murdoch University in Australia. Manufacturer location: Murdoch University in Perth, Australia   == When and where it was tested/implemented == A research group is currently developing the technology to be feasible, and if successful, will collaborate with a drug company to begin human trials."
