function = "Teammates from Guatemala, Honduras, Tibet, and Zambia are collaborating on an income generating project that has applications all over the world. The team is working to improve upon existing designs of presses, so that communities can use locally available resources and skills to produce soil blocks in order to make building projects more accessible. Production of soil compressed blocks is environmentally friendly, because only very little water, very little cement and no firewood are used in production. Unfortunately, even the most affordable block makers are prohibitively expensive, have low throughput and require frequent maintenance. Additionally, many building projects face high materials costs."
