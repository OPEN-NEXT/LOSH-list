With the help of oraganizations like MADRE and OWFI, many of the nations youth, Sunni and Shia alike, have rallied together through art, music, and poetry to promote peace.   === MADRE === MADRE is an international organization that works together with other community based organizations to promote a wide variety of human rights including women's rights, health, and education. It began in 1983 when a group of women travelled to Nicaragua after the US led Contra war. Kathy Engel, MADRE's founding director, envisioned a completely women run human rights organization."
