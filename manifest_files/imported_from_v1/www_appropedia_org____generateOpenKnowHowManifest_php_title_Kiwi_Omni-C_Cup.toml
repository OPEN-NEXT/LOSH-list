function = "== Problem being addressed == Due to the invasive nature of the cesarean section, there are many complications that may hurt the or even kill the mother, including: maternal blood loss, infection, uterine rupture, placental accreta, placental increta, placental percreta, etc. Decreasing the invasiveness of the procedure may reduce the problems with these issues.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Kiwi Omni-C Cup is a vacuum cup that attaches to the fundal end of the fetal head after the incision into the uterus. The cup applies a suction seal to the fetus after pumping of the suction pump by the physician. Then the physician pulls the fetus from the mother by using the Kiwi device."
