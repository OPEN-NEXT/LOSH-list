function = "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in agriculture can identify areas of current practices that require improvement, such as water resource management, energy use, land use, or greenhouse gas emission. These factors contribute to global warming potential (GWP), soil acidification, and eutrophication. The various environmental impacts related to large-scale livestock production are dependent on the types of farming practices. The types of feed, housing, equipment, and waste management are all factors that contribute to the overall impact associated with livestock production. This page is a review of LCA literature on the subject of livestock production, more specifically, the impacts associated with raising and harvesting pigs."
