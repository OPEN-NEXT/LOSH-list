function = "Linux is a free open-source operating system which has been steadily gaining popularity in institutions and with individual users.   == Why is Linux appropriate for UTC Parras? == The vulnerability of Windows to viruses and spyware has made systems slow and unstable at UTC Parras.  At the beginning of the summer 2006 HSU Parras program, the Windows server providing access to the internet was infected with malware making internet access extremely slow and unstable.  Replacing the server with an inexpensive router partially solved this problem."
