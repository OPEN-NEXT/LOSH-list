function = "A thermostatic valve for a solar water pasteurization device. See Adapted thermostatic valve for water pasteurization for final design. For our APSC 100 project we need to design a thermostatic valve for a solar water pasteurization device. This thermostatic valve must be fabricated from materials that would be easily found or purchased by local craftsman.   == Understanding the Market == When considering what materials to use in our designs, the following must be kept in mind:  Is it found locally?\ndevelopment, industry, water, water pasteurization"
