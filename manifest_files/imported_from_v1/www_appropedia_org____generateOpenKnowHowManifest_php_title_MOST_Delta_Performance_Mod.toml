Using this enclosure, ABS and nylon are now within reach of any MOST Delta builder with a simple modification that can be completed in the average dorm room.  \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t   == Bill of Materials == (3) 12x18in thick cardboard Aluminum Foil to Cover   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Total assembly time is roughly one hour.."
