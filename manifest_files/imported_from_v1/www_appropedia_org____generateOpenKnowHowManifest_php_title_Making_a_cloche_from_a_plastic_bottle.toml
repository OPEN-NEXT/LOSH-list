function = "This cloche can be used to protect seeds and seedlings during the colder part of the growing season, keeping them warm and safe from snails and slugs.  Select a plastic drinking bottle. The size depends on how many seeds or seedlings you want to cover at once. You can always make a few, as the plastic bottle is ubiquitous and cheap. Empty the bottle of any liquid."
