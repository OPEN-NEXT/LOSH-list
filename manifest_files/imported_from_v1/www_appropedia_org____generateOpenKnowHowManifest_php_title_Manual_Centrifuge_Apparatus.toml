function = "Manual Centrifuge Apparatus is a scientific equipment which is widely used in chemical and clinical labs all around the world. This apparatus is used to separate two fluids with different densities when rotated at very high speeds. This apparatus uses the physical phenomenon of centrifugal force acted outward from the centre of rotation. Due to this outward acting force, fluid with higher density tends to move away from the centre and thus forming the bottom layer between the two fluids.   == Bill of Materials == 1."
