function = "The electronics and software detailed here measures quantities related to DC electrical energy production from micro-renewables. Including: Voltage, Current and Power. (It will soon measure total energy produced and a few other useful quantities) These values are useful for: Sizing the loads - how many lights, computers, batteries etc can be connected. Monitoring the state of charge of the batteries. Monitoring the performance of the system."
