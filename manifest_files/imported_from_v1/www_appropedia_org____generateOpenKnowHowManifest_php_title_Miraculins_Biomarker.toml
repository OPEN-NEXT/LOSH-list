function = "== Problem being addressed == Pre-eclampsia affects over three million mothers worldwide each year and is also associated with premature birth. Regular blood pressure (BP) monitoring is a cost-effective means of identifying hypertensive diseases in their early stages. However, there are currently no effective ways to detect a womenâ€™s likelihood to suffer from pre-eclampsia prior to developing the condition.   == Detailed description of the solution == The research done to advance this device is the first major development of a reliable biomarker diagnostic that can accurately predict the onset of pre-eclampsia. The presence of this biomarker also strongly suggests that pre-eclampsia is characterized by abnormal placenta formation which limits the amount of oxygen that can be delivered to the developing fetus during pregnancy."
