function = "== Problem being addressed == Eclampsia accounts for about 40% of maternal mortality in low resource environments. This condition is characterized by high blood pressure and heightened protein in the urine. Identifying these stages early is essential for successful treatment. However, the tools for detecting blood pressure and analyzing urine are expensive and inaccessible for women in developing countries.   == Detailed description of the solution == Instead of testing blood pressure or urine, the momedemameter detects for edema, another indicator of pre-eclampsia and other pregnancy issues."
