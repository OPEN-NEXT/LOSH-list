function = "Adjustable Monochromator. A monochromator is a device which takes light and transmits it to into a narrow band of wavelengths. Using a form of mechanical filtering (diffraction) the user is able to select a specific wavelength (color) which would exit through a exit slit. The monochromator holds many scientific applications ranging from measuring a reflected or transmitted light off a surface. By branching two assemblies together, one can produce a excitation wavelength aiming at the second which can analyze the emitted light."
