function = "In early years, as well as in developing areas, humans did not have the technology to ventilate their buildings through mechanical and electrical components.  Yet, they were able to sufficiently provide ventilation by designing their buildings in such a way that would allow for decent ventilation without any electricity or power. As the name suggests, natural ventilation involves the exchange of air between the inside and outside of a building through natural methods.  This approach often utilizes naturally available forces, such as wind and pressure.  By implementing natural ventilation, plenty of electricity can be saved with little to no decrease in internal air quality, provided the building is designed in a suitable manner."
