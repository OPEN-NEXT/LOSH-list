function = "Newspaper Briquette Makers are used by a wide range of people. They are used by people in developed countries mainly to create fuel bricks for fireplaces. However, for people in developing countries, they can be used to create fuel, but also actual bricks used create structures if they are made well enough. Most of the existing designs involve getting down on your knees and applying a great amount of force using only you arms (Commercial Briquette Makers & Costs). This technique thus limits than range and amount of people able to use those makers."
