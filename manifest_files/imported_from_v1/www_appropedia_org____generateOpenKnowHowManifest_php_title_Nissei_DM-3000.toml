function = "== Problem being addressed == Accurately measuring blood pressure is important for checking the status changes of a patient but sometimes medical personnel are not properly trained to take vital signs. There was a need for an efficient, accurate and low-cost way to take blood pressure that excludes human error.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Nessei DM-3000 device has an automatic blood pressure cuff. The cuff is designed to automatically measure the blood pressure and pulse of a patient, eliminating the need for a health worker to manually listen for a heartbeat. The device is battery operated for easy use and keeps a record of previous blood pressure measurements."
