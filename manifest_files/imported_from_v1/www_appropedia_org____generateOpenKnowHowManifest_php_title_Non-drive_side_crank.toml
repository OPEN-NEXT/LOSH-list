function = "The project is a part of the bike, offered by Dr. John Gershenson. It is designed based on a real drive-side model since I only find drive-side model from the lab. I choose to design the non-drive side part since the strength of the gear can not be reached by using plastic material to print. All size are matched with the original one."
