function = "== Problem being addressed == 500 million mothers die each year from child-birth related causes in developing nations. A major cause of maternal mortality is eclampsia, which can kill the mother and the baby during childbirth. Therefore, detection of preeclampsia is vital to treatment.   == Detailed description of the solution == Deregulation of the protein HtrA3 has been linked to preeclampsia. Detection of the protein via antibody assays has been developed to measure the level of HtrA3 in human blood."
