function = "The treadle pump is a lift pump designed to irrigate small plots of land. Treadle pumps are designed to be operated by the farmer or hand in a \"stair stepper\" type motion to lift water from a depth of not over seven meters. Pumps manufacrtured today such as this one are typically made of welded steel components with O ring seals. O rings are not readily available and having the skills and equipment to weld the components is rare in remote communities. Another large component of cost is the check valves."
