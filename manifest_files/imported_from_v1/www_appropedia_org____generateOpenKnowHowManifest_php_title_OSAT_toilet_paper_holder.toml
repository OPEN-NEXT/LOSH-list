function = "This toilet paper holder is an appropriate technology because it allows people in developing countries to store and use their toilet paper cleanly. The pole can be used to store rolls of toilet paper vertically, and then the actual holder on top will hold the toilet paper as it is dispensed.   == Bill of Materials == PLA plastic filament CAD and STL files   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == N/A   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Make sure when slicing the parts, it is in the best orientation for printing. In other words, make sure the toilet paper holder is flipped so that the base is on the bed, not the spoke. Only one of the stand and holder are needed, however you can print as many of the poles as needed to increase the overall height of the stand."
