function = "The objective of the Growbot is to create an open-source autonomous robot that will aid in the farming process and provide a platform that can be used for other purposes as seen fit.   == Background == The goal of this project is to manufacture a robot, about 1 cubic foot in size, that can automate the process of farming most garden crops. This would include tilling and planting the seeds, maintaining constant moisture and nutrient levels, and weeding around the plant. The robot will be made of 3D printed and easy to source components making it low-cost and available to be assembled by most home users. The Growbot will be a time-saver for users and make sure that plants get the correct amount of water and fertilizer at all times."
