PLoS ONE 8(3): e59840. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0059840 open access   == Version 1 == It should be noted that these sample holders can also be used to hold appropriately sized stationary mirrors. The sample holder consists of three components: the metal rod, the plastic base, and the sample clamp."
