function = "poor geometric design for function In much of the developing world it is very common to collect water in a bucket this water is then used for around the house needs. Having the water in a bucket however can make it somewhat difficult to use as you have poor control when pouring the bucket out. The simple solution and the one that many people use its to use some sort of cup in the bucket. My design uses a 3D printable pump to allow the user to pump the water out. This has several advantages."
