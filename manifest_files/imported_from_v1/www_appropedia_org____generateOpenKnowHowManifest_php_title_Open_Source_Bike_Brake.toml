function = "This project is an attempt to create a simple bicycle brake for the open source community. This brake relies on minimal hardware and uses scarp rubber for the brake pad material. If the users budget allows, conventional bike brake pads could be utilized. These brakes are adjustable to fit a multitude of bikes as long as they have a provision for brakes on the forks of the frame. These brakes are also lighter than conventional materials."
