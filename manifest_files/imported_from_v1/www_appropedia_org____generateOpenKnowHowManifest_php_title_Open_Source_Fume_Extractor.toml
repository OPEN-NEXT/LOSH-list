Recent articles suggest that fumes may also be a result of 3D printing, so it may be used as an application for that as well.   == Project goals == Design box Make design resizable Prototype design Order parts Test fit/build   == Design == All design files are hosted on http://3dprint.nih.gov The links for each file are listed below.   == Costs == This table shows the cost savings for the current modifications to the chamber.   == Soldering Instructions == Solder a positive battery snap wire (red) to the other snap's negative (black) wire."
