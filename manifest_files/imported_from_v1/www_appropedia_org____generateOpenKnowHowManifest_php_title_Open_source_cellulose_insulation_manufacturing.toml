function = "The goal of this project is to create an open source cellulose insulation manufacturing machine for the goal of local production of cellulose insulation from post consumer paper waste. Local manufacturing would reduce embodied energy of transportation and provide a valuable product from local waste streams - particularly in cold climates like the UP! The machine will process post-consumer paper sourced locally to create the 75-85% recycled paper fiber and then mix it with the other 15%-25% of a fire retardant such as boric acid.  Cellulose Insulation is one of the greenest products in the world as it both saves energy by conserving heat in buildings and it is made from recycled paper (newsprint and other paper sources), paper that might otherwise end up in landfills, releasing greenhouse gases as it decomposed.  Lowest embodied energy of any insulation (fiberglass is 10X as much, foam 60X)  Green building material for LEED sound proofing, insulation, and fire retardation."
