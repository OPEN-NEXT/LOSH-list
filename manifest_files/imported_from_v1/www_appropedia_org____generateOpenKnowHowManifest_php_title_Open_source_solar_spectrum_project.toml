function = "The goal for this Open Source Solar Spectrum Analyzer was to collaboratively design the mechanical and electronic controls for a direct/diffuse data acquisition of wavelength and tilt angle dependent solar flux. In this project we built and commissioned two systems (1 in Canada and 1 in Bolivia). The systems will adjust a fiber optic input from 0 to 90 degrees every ten degrees and measure global and diffuse by adjusting a shadow band in and out. These measurements occur every hour and have enough resolution to span the UV-VIS to NIR spectrum. In order to accomplish this, Queens Applied Sustainability Group in Kingston Ontario joined up with the La Universidad Privada Boliviana[1] in Cochabamba, Bolivia."
