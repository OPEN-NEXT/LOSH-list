function = "The intent of this project, created in collaboration with Mech425, is to identify the best angle for flat, uniform blades in relationship to the air stream. The angle of the blades should be optimized to convert the most amount of energy into rotational motion. Flat blades are used in conjunction with vertical axis turbines and the design is generally selected when simplicity is preferred or when access to tools and supplies are limited.  The project has been selected to provide support to individuals looking to generate electricity by harvesting the wind The target audience are people who cannot afford commercially available models and have chosen to build their own Windmills have many functions and can be operated wherever there is access to wind. Windmills use their blades to convert the energy in wind into rotational motion."
