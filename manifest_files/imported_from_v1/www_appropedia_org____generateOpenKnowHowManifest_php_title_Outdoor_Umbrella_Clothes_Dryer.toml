function = "Abstract \tLooking at the uses for appropriate technology, the household clothes dryer is near the top of the list for one of the least efficient appliances. The cloths dryer uses roughly 5.8% of the energy from an individual household. It typically costs 30 to 40 cents to dry a load of laundry in an electric dryer and approximately 15 to 20 cents in a gas dryer. Over its expected lifetime of 18 years, the average clothes dryer will cost you approximately $1,530 to operate, according to the EIA (Energy Information Administration).    == Project Goals == To create an alternative to the household clothes dryer to reduce energy consumption in ones home."
