For more information on PET mechanisms please see the PET Extrusion literature review.   == Shredding and Cleaning == Any PET bottles or containers which are to be to be recycled need to be ground up into smaller pieces first. This is to speed up the drying process, and also, to fit the plastic into the RecycleBot hopper. Approximately 1/4 of the mass of an average water bottle is in the thred and cap region of the main body."
