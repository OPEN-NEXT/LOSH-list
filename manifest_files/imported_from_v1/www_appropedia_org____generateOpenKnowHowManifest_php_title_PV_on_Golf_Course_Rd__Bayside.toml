function = "On site Photovoltaic & Solar Heating system on Golf Course Rd, Bayside Presented by Ben Scurfield This site displayed a grid-tied photovoltaic and thermal heating system. Net metering is used on grid tied systems. This means that the excesses power produced in a given day is sold to PG&E and then bought back when needed at night. PV panels do not produce energy when blocked by shadows such as a tree or structure. For maximum efficiency the Panels should be adjusted +15 degrees in winter and -15 degrees in summer."
