There was a previous version, but after some research, a new team came in and updated this ventilator to make it more lightweight, cheap, and pleasing to the eye. Three unique subgroups were needed in order to complete this project. The Packaging team had the main goal of redesigning the packaging that held the components of the ventilator.
