function = "It goes without saying that paper has many uses and can be created with little effort.  It's a useful material that can often be made using recycled or damaged materials, and can be made with materials found in almost any non-desert environment. This short tutorial is mostly aimed at recycling or creating one's own paper from scratch for whatever purpose you feel like.  Communication often is expedited by posting fliers or having handouts available and this technique may with some luck expedite grassroots organization in areas with little resources.   == Background == Paper has it's origins in China sometime around 300 BCE to 104 BCE.  They used planets like willow, bamboo, and hemp for pulp."
