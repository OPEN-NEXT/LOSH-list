function = "== Problem being addressed == Coliforms in water have been found to be associated with hydrogen sulphide (H2S)-producing organisms, or bacteria. Water tests in developing countries need to be low-cost and involve minimal equipment.   == Detailed description of the solution == The H2S test is used to test drinking water for fecal contamination. The test uses common laboratory chemicals and is performed by adding a specified amount of \"boiled\" water in addition to a common liquid detergent to an H2S paper strip. After drying in a low-heat oven, the test water is collected and stored in a dark room for three days."
