Their final design project for the Spring 2007 session of ME 379 Thermal-Fluids Lab is based on an experimental low-cost peak flow meter originally designed by Steve McCrosky.   == Abstract == A Peak Flow Meter (PFM) was designed to achieve consistent exhalation results for the diagnosis and management of asthma. A calibration procedure was used to modify the flow meter to achieve consistency. To accomplish this, the behavioral characteristics of air, the working fluid, had to be understood."
