function = "Pedregal is the Permaculture Demonstration Center in San Andres Huayapam and it is a project from the Institute of Nature and Society of Oaxaca (INSO). The demonstration center began in 2005 in order to: regenerate the aquifer capacity, provide opportunities to families in the surrounding communities for sustainable production, and build a center of experimentation and research in organic farming techniques, restoration of canyons, and integrated water management. Today we have an ecological house and multiple projects in order to better manage water use, protect soils, produce organic foods, and save energy. We have planted ground covers, fruit trees, native plants, cactus, corn, and vegetables. We are also raising bees, fish and poultry."
