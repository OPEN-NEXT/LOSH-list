Centro De Salud had a list of items that needed to be purchased at their hospital. Among these was a new vaccine refrigerator. After learning of this, the project group members set out to design a PV system for the hospital that could fulfill this need. PV systems are well suited for vaccine refrigeration for a few reasons.\nrefrigeration"
