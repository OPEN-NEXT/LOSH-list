Specifically we've developed tools that can be used to easily convert a car alternator into an electric generator for a picoHydro system. This webpage is about the \"PicoHydro Generator\" Project from the 2008 International Design for Development Summit (IDDS, http://web.archive.org/web/20150308172335/http://iddsummit.org:80/), organized by Amy Smith of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and others contributors.
