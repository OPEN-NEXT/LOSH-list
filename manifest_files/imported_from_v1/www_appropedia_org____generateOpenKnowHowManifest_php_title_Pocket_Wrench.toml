function = "The pocket wrench is an excellent example of OSAT. Wrenches are a universal necessity, especially in third world countries where buying something new, rather than repairing something, is seldom an option. In addition to this, this wrench is small and cheap to make.   == Bill of Materials == Any 3D printable plastic The link to download this design can be found here [1]   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == No special skills were used to produce this wrench, other than basic 3D printing knowledge.   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == My print was made by extruding the PLA at 240C. I used this high of a temperature because my 3D printer is located in a room that is not heated, and as such, higher extrusion temperatures are needed to allow the filament to extrude properly. The print was made using a 60% hexagonal infill, this allows for the structure to maintain its rigidity, and be used for the application."
