function = "Before introducing the project I have chosen to put my efforts towards, I first need to introduce a larger project that will take my smaller project upon it's completion and introduce it--among additional projects--to others. The larger project I am speaking of is the Waterpodâ„¢ Project--a self-sufficient habitat on a reborn industrial barge, but their website spells it all out much eloquenter than I can. The project I will be working on is some sort of portable bicycle-powered electricity generator stand. Bicycle-powered generators convert the mechanical energy in the pedaling of pedals into electricity using magnets. The magnets are part of what is called a brushed DC electric motorW (also called a permanent magnet generator), which basically works by spinning a bipolar magnet surrounded by another bipolar magnet."
