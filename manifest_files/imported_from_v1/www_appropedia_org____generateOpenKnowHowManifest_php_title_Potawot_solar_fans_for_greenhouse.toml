We evaluated project criteria and put together a comprehensive literature review before beginning our design process. After researching about greenhouses, solar panels and fans, we began to brainstorm prototypes detailing the fan placement, where to put the panel, and how the wiring would look for a direct connection, and with a battery. After reaching out to an expert, we finalized our design and sent away for parts.\nventilation, cooling, air circulation, agriculture"
