function = "Herbs, spices and chillies are produced in India and Brazil extensively. But lack of simple and cost-effective technology is a big issue in rural regions of such developing countries. Usually, herbs and dried chillies are made into a powdered form using heavy stones for crushing purpose. Thus considering the amount of input work and its output, I have designed a simple but robust grinder which is very cost effective and can be used by anyone for the same purpose.   == Bill of Materials == PLA filament- $1  https://www.youmagine.com/designs/powder-maker-chillies-and-herbs   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer PLA Filament   == Skills and knowledge needed == 3D Modelling Software Matter control software   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Download the .stl files from YouMagine website."
