function = "== Problem being addressed == In India, individuals who lack use of their legs, whether through injury or congenital disability, often cannot afford prostheses. This lack of access negatively affects an individual's quality of life and ability to earn income.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Prabha foot is a lightweight (2 kg), above-the-knee prosthetic limb. It is easily repairable with local parts, and costs approximately $50 USD. With government subsidy, Indian patients pay as little as 38 rupees (<$1 USD).   == Relevance to developing country settings == The Prabha foot was designed in India for use by Indians."
