function = "== Problem being addressed == Preterm birth is a leading cause in neonatal deaths, and these deaths are most common in low-resource settings where many infants are born at home and trained medical professionals are scarce. Methods to accurately estimate gestational age are often complex and community health workers (CHW) do not have the education and skills to accurately assess the infants. As a result, many preterm infants go unrecognized, which can cause severe morbidity or even mortality.   == Detailed description of the solution == The pictorial scorecard is designed so that CHWs can identify early preterm (<34 weeks) and late preterm (34-37 weeks) infants. The card includes a chart of five physical characteristics – skin texture, ear shape, breast form, foot skin creases, and lanugo – that can be easily assessed without expensive technology or complex computations."
