function = "One of the biggest hurdles in developing nations is locating locally sources and affordable parts and expendables, including filament for use at tech labs in rural Africa. To solve this problem, Principia students created a preliminary design and developed a filament extruder that could use recycled plastic bottles (ubiquitous in the waste stream even in rural developing towns) to manufacture usable filament.   == Project goal == The overall goal of the project was to create an affordable and effective filament extruder that could process recycled plastic bottles that could be used in third-world countries. This overall would promote sustainability while creating accessible manufacturing for those that need it. Another feature of this goal was improving the usage recycle waste PETG plastics that abound in every remote corner of the globe, by transforming it into usable 3D printing filament which can then be used locally to produce sustainable solutions to issues local communities in food production, health services, and other areas."
