function = "== Problem being addressed == Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a major cause of child mortality. It is often treated using bubble CPAP (bCPAP), but these devices can cost thousands of dollars and are too expensive for low-resource settings.   == Detailed description of the solution == This bCPAP technology uses low-cost aquarium pumps to generate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This keeps the infantâ€™s lungs inflated, which allows them to breathe easier. This technology can be sold for as low as $160, which an estimated maintenance of only 25 cents every two years (diaphragm replacement)."
