function = "== Problem being addressed == In many low-income countries such as Bangladesh, the majority of deliveries are performed at home by a traditional birth attendant (TBA). These TBAs may or may not be properly trained in the diagnosis and treatment of post-partum hemorrhage (PPH), which is frequently the leading cause of maternal death.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Quaiyum Blood Mat is an absorbent mat to be placed under a woman during delivery that can absorb up to 500mL of blood. Blood travels across the mat at a constant velocity, allowing the TBA to visually evaluate blood loss. When the mat is saturated at 500mL, it will start to leak, which signals PPH.   == Designed by == Designed by: Professor Dr."
