function = "Isla Urbana is a nonprofit working in Mexico City as well as in other areas of Mexico to improve water quality and water accessibility to people who have no reliable access to clean water. They coordinate efforts with different communities to build local capacity and local jobs for designing and building rainwater catchment systems around Mexico. They provide design assistance, training to plumbers, and provide parts for the rainwater harvesting systems. This is one project in a series of water quality and community service projects at Isla Urbana. Water access is often unreliable in Mexico City and many poor or migrant or immigrant communities are the last to receive any service in terms of access to municipal water."
