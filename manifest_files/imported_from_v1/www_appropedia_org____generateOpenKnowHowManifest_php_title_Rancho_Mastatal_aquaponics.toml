function = "An aquaponics system at Rancho Mastatal grows edible plants and raises fish for consumption. The fish waste provides nutrients for the plants, and the plants clean the water for the fish. The system has four plant beds and the fish tank can support up to 40 tilapia. The only necessary inputs to keep the system functioning are energy to power the pump that cycles water up to the fish tank, and food for the fish. Fish food is provided by the Rancho Mastatal site."
