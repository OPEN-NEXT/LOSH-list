function = "The earthen rocket oven at Rancho Mastatal was originally built as a standard earthen oven. Overtime, they decided that the cooking style of the earthen oven did not fit their needs. Quicker cooking methods were needed. Instead of deconstructing the earthen oven, they decided to reconstruct it as an earthen rocket oven using principles from the rocket stove.   == Components == The table below describes the components of the earthen rocket oven."
