function = "== Problem being addressed == Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs due to uncontrollable levels of blood glucose with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. This can cause several serious health problems for both mother and child, including the predisposition of Type 2 diabetes. The current tests in place to regulate glucose levels often demand fasting and multiple hours to complete, leading to low patient compliance.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Rapid Strip Assay (RDT) is meant to identify a new biomarker, glycated albumin, which can diagnose GDM within several minutes.  This allows a cheaper and faster method to determine if pregnant mothers or their babies will develop diabetes."
