function = "This project is an upgrade on the current Recyclebot v5.0 cooling section. The previous design uses a top-down approach at cooling off the filament post extrusion, this was rather annoying to initially feed the filament through. To get rid of that issue, I created a way for the fans to permanently mount to the bottom and have the air funneled to the filament via a 3D printed shroud. This solution makes it easier to initially feed the filament through, while still gently cooling off the filament and the aluminum trough itself. This project is Appropriate because it is part of a machine that can be built for less than $600 and make filament that is comparable to that bought from a supplier."
