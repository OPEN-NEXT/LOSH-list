function = "Relocalization is a strategy which aims to rebuild societies based on the local provisioning of food and energy, and the relocalization of currency, governance and culture. The main goals of relocalization are to increase community energy security, strengthen local economies, and dramatically improve environmental conditions and social equity. The strategy of relocalization was being developed and implemented by the Post Carbon Institute, through a Relocalization Network website. More recently this initiative has moved to the Resilience website. This Relocalization Network was composed of Local Post Carbon Groups from all over the world, working to prepare their communities for an energy constrained future."
