function = "== Problem being addressed == Trauma fractures are a devastating consequence of auto and motorcycle accidents, which are more common in developing countries. Without receiving surgical intervention the bones may not repair properly, possibly leading to permanent disability. There is a need for a simple, low-cost treatment for such bone fractures.   == Detailed description of the solution == The SIGN Intramedullary (IM) Nail secures broken pieces of the bone together to ensure proper healing. The IM nail is a long rod made of surgical-grade stainless steel that passes through the canal of the bone to hold the pieces together."
