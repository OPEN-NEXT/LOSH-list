function = "== Problem being addressed == There is a tremendous need for assistive technologies to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities in developing countries. In particular, the need for wheelchairs is estimated to be anywhere between 20 million and 100 million worldwide. Due to several factors, including an underdeveloped healthcare system, stigmas associated with disability, and the below-average income of most disabled people in India, there is a high need for wheelchairs and other assisted technologies.   == Detailed description of the solution == The key feature of this device is that it can operate on rough terrain. In order to do this, one of the wheelchairâ€™s key features is a fifth wheel located under the seat that is connected to the motor used for propulsion."
