function = "== Problem being addressed == Many infections result from improper umbilical cord care and wound treatment, especially in regions such as southeast Asia and Africa where home births are common.  The SafeSnip device makes umbilical cord disposal safer, easier, and more sanitary.   == Detailed description of the solution == SafeSnip is a three-inch plastic disposable and degradable device that cuts, seals, and disinfects umbilical cords in a simple, one-step procedure. SafeSnip breaks in to two after being used to cut the cord such that one half of the device remains clamped onto the baby's umbilical cord to seal the wound while the other can be discarded.  Its symmetric design and multiple safety features minimize misuse and shorten the delivery process."
