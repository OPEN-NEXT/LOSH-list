function = "== Problem being addressed == Anemia is a major cause of maternal mortality and it remains a prominent issue in developing countries. Methods to accurately diagnose this condition are inadequate in these regions. The Sally Centrifuge, with its mechanically-powered, cost-efficient and portable design, hopes to bring accurate diagnostic technology to low-resource areas.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Sally Centrifuge is composed of hair combs, a salad spinner and a round plastic container.  It spins small capillary tubes filled with blood for ten minutes with manual pumping."
