function = "A rainwater catchment system was designed and constructed at The Sanctuary in Arcata, CA. This project was completed for Humboldt State University class, ENGR 215 FALL 16, and is a collaboration between four students: Jenna Davey, Karen Duarte, Richard Thompson, and Caleb Wegener. The catchment system can hold up to 900 gallons of captured rainwater. A 55 gallon drum is used as the secondary storage. A 850 gallon pond acts as the primary storage for the system. The pond is covered with a bridge, for walking or storage, and the pond contains an overflow drain."
