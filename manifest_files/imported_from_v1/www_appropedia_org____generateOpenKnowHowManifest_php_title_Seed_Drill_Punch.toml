function = "== 3D Printed Seed Drill Punch for Hard Soil == Project developed by --Jmbrooki (talk) 07:05, 2 December 2014 (PST)  \t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t   == Abstract == In the most basic form, a seed drill is a device that will position seeds in soil, without waste. This idea was an improvement over sowing seeds, where soil was tilled and seeds were thrown over the dirt. Before a mechanical device was invented, the solution was to individually plant seeds, by hand. My proposed improvement is to create a seed reservoir, which will resemble a funnel, with the drill punch going through the center. This design will allow seed to be distributed into individual holes, regardless of soil compaction."
