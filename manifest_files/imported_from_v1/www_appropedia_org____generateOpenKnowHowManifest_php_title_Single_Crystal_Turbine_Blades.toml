function = "Gas turbines, as with all areas of power production, are highly dependent on thermal efficiency to effectively produce power. There are several ways in industry to increase the thermal efficiency of a gas turbine power cycle. These methods of increasing efficiency are almost always limited by the metallurgical properties of the turbine components. The thermal efficiency of gas turbine can be greatly increased with components that are able to withstand higher working temperatures. The use of single crystal superalloy turbine blades allows for this to be possible."
