function = "== Designer == Toni Pasanen' Aalto University, Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering   == Project == Single wafer boxes are a handy way to pack wafers securely e.g. during shipping or to store valuable samples firmly and securely. However, commecial products (e.g., here or here) are designed only for full wafers, and sometimes there is a need to store smaller samples, e.g. wafer quarters. Since the commercial products have a support for samples only at the edges, wafer quarters lie on the bottom at the center and can almost freely move in the box, which causes sample scratching."
