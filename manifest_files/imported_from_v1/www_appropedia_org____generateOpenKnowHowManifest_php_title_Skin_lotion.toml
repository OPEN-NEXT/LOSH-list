function = "Heat up 3/4 Cup of Oil of Your Choice in the microwave with 2 teaspoons of Steric Acid and 1 teaspoon of Emulsifying Wax until melted. In a separate plastic bowl with a pour mouth preferably, heat up 1/2 cup of water of your choice (such as rainwater) in the microwave with a 1/2 teaspoon of Borax until boiling hot. Then use the same plastic pour mouth bowl you boiled the water in and slowly whip in the oil mixture with a hand blender. Keep mixing until fairly cool. At this time, you can add Vitamin-E oil, a little color, fragrance, whatever you consider great stuff!"
