function = "Make simple and easy soil blocks for starting seeds.   == Introduction ==  If you want to start your plants indoors weeks before you can put them into the ground, soil blocks is the way to go. They have many advantages, but the main one is that soil blocks GREATLY reduce transplant shock, leaving you with more survivors in your garden.  They won't create root balls like starter pots or trays, they don't limit roots in the soil like peat or paper pots, and they don't destroy roots like flats.  Making soil blocks requires a soil block maker, or blocker."
