function = "Solar chimney's are in extensive use, but this design has not been prototyped. A solar chimney, or thermal chimney, is a form of passive ventilation that can be applied to a structure. It uses the principles of heat transfer and fluid mechanics to naturally ventilate a structure without the need of an outside source of electricity. This makes the solar chimney a promising alternative to forced air in both the developed and the developing world. Indoor air quality is a health issue that plagues the developing world.\nventilation"
