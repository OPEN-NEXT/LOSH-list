function = "I carried out this project during one of my semesters where I designed a solar water heating system using Parabolic Trough Collector and Fresnel Collector for a textile industry in Pakistan. Moreover, a comparative analysis of both types of collectors was also performed. The Project detailed theoretical understanding of solar water heaters as well as numerical calculations related to solar irradiance, solar beam direction, sun tracking strategies, heat transfer, thermal collector efficiency etc. Prior knowledge of solar analysis will indeed be an excellent help when carrying out research on Agrivoltaics. Hence, this project has equipped me with the basic tools related to solar energy which will be beneficial to carry out future work in the domain of Agrivoltaics.\n"
