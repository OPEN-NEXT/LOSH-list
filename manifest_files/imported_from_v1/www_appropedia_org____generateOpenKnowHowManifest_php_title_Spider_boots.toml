function = "The Spider Boot Foot Protection System is a truly revolutionary design for protecting a deminer's feet and legs against blast-type anti-personnel mines. It can be worn without training in almost any terrain for reconnaissance, detection and victim assistance. The Spider Boot Foot Protection System elevates the foot so blast energy and fragments disperse and deflect away from the foot. The hull absorbs residual blast energy and fragments."
