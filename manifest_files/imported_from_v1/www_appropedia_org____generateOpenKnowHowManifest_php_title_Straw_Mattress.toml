function = "I needed a mattress, so I made one. Then I needed a bed frame that would hold it off the floor, so I made one. It was surprisingly simple. I used a zippered mattress protector and half of a three-string straw bale. For the rope frame, I used a free bed frame, 100 feet of paracord, and two 2x4s."
