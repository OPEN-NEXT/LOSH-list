function = "non parametric not looped no holes for permanent fixturing   == Tent Vertex Joint == Project developed by User:jcismith   == Abstract == The purpose of this build was to make it easier and more convenient for individuals around the world to construct shelters with the resources available to them. The tent vertex joint accomplishes this by providing a sturdy point to join multiple poles for constructing a tent.     == Bill of Materials == Filament Design files (OpenSCAD and STL): | Youmagine Link   == Tools needed ==  MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == Knowledge of OpenSCAD is needed to manipulate the vertex joint if necessary.   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions ==   === Print Directions === There is one .stl file for this print available to download.    ==== Layer Height ==== It is recommended to print at a layer height of 0.1mm for a good quality vertex joint printed accurately."
