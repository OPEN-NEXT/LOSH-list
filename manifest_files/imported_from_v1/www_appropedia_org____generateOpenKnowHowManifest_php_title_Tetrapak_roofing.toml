function = "Tetrapaks are almost universal over the whole planet. And, up 'til now, they have been very difficult to recycle. Each is made of a sandwich, printed plastic on the outside of a layer of white paper and aluminum foil on the inside. The aluminum seems to have a coating too. These three layers are very hard to separate."
