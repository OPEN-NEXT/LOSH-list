function = "The Solar Radiation Monitoring Station (259 SoRMS) project is one of Humboldt's Renewable Energy Students Union's (RESU) responses to the need for more renewable energy. The basic idea behind this specific system is not to create power but to collect information on solar power. As demonstrated in the photo above, the usable Solar Radiation is more complicated than simply what the sun emits. The atmosphere in which the radiation travels through needs to be taken into account due to it's distorting effects on usable energy at the surface. Because of the localized weather in coastal zones, most solar research facilities do not deal with the thick cloud cover found there."
