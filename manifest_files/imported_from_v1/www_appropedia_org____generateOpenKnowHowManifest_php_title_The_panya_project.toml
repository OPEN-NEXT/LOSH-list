function = "The Panya Project, a permaculture farm originally called the \"Baan Thai Project\" was proposed in 2002 by Christian Shearer. Shearer, the current director of the project, chose Thailand as the location of the project because he had experience in the area and his parents owned a piece of land in the country. Located in Mae Taeng, Chiang Mai, Thailand, the sustainable living project operates by implementing permaculture and hosts workshops for visitors and volunteers in both Thai and English. Natural building is implemented at the location and the usage of adobe is prevalent in design. A list of courses is available on the Panya Project website, course include: Introduction to Permaculture, Permaculture Design and Permaculture teacher training courses."
