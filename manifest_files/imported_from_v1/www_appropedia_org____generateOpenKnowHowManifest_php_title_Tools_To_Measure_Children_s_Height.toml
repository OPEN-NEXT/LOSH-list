function = "== Tools To Measure Children's Height == Project developed by Katherine Wendt   == Abstract == This OSAT allows for children's heights to be accurately measured in any environment. Traditional stadiometers are expensive, costing around $159, which can be every expensive in low-income and rural areas. The simple design of braces and a tape measure eliminates the need for expensive equipment in developing regions. Measuring children's height over a period of time and seeing growth indicates that they are growing properly. In combination with their weight and age, their BMI can be calculated to see if they are properly nourished and active."
