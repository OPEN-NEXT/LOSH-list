function = "This project is to build a barn for Tule Fog Farm in Arcata, California, while at the same time converting a brownfield into a productive space for agriculture. Most of the construction was completed in the spring of 2012 in order to accommodate for incoming litters of piglets. The green roof provides insulation for the interior of the barn, as well as an area that animals may have access to in the future. It has also improved the appearance of the location, what used to be an eyesore has become an attractive view with a purpose. The wood used to construct this barn was all sourced locally, and labor was on a work-trade and internship basis."
