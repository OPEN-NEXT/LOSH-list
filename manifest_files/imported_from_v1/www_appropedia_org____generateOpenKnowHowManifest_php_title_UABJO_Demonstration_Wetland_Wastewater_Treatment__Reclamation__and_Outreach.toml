function = "In 2006, the University of Benito Juarez in Oaxaca, Mexico (UABJO) implemented a natural wastewater treatment, reuse, demonstration and outreach program. This program continues to grow and has yielded many measurable successes, as depicted by following three elements:  Applied Bachelor's and Master's Chemistry Academic Programs. These water quality focused, service-learning programs are providing surrounding communities assesments of potable water and treated wastewater quality. In addition, coursework evaluates levels of contamination in the major waterways of the Oaxaca Valley, such as the Rio Salado and Rio Atoyac. Although water quality analyses are conducted in the University laboratory by students, and are not nationally certified, this data is helping to fill in largely non-existent environmental water quality inforation within the region."
