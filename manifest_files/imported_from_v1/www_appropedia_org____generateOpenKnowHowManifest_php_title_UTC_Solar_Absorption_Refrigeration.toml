function = "== Objective == As part of the Humboldt State University Parras Summer Program, we were given the chance to plan and construct an appropriate technology project of our choosing. As the result of a brainstorm in the beginning of the program, we decided that a solar powered refrigeration system would be well suited for the area. Our overall challenge being that it would not utilize electricity as its energy source. The possibility of having a refrigeration system \"off-grid\" is a huge advantage in Northern Mexico (as well as other parts of the world). There are many circumstances where people do not have access to electricity or gas to power a refrigeration system."
