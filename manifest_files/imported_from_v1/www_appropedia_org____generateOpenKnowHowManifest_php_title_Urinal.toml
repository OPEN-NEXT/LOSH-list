function = "A Urinal is only used for collecting urine. Urinals are generally for men, although Urinals for women have also been developed. Urinals for women consist of raised foot-steps and a sloped channel or catchment area for conducting the urine to a collection technology. For men, Urinals can either be wall-mounted units that are vertical, or squat slabs that the user squats over. Most Urinals use water for flushing, but waterless Urinals are becoming increasingly popular."
