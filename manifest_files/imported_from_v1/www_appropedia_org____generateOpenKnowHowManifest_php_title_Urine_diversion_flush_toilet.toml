function = "The Urine Diverting Flush Toilet (UDFT) is similar in appearance to a Cistern Flush Toilet except for the diversion in the bowl. The toilet bowl has two sections so that the urine can be separated from the faeces. When the user sits on the toilet, urine is collected in a drain in the front (where there is no water) and faeces are collected in the back (where there is water). The urine is collected without water, but a small amount of water is used to rinse the urine-collection bowl after the user stands up. The urine flows into a storage tank for further use or processing, while the faeces are flushed with water to be treated."
