function = "== Creator == Project developed by Adam Pringle   == Background == Sifting a desired material from another has been done throughout history since the dawn of agriculture. One widely used application is the process of separating grain from chaff for grain crops.  Sifting material is not limited to food crops, but can also be helpful for separating soil into various grades.   == Abstract == This OSAT project is meant to provide utility in sifting for a variety of applications. This sifter is appropriate because it costs about $1.42 to create provided one has access to a 3D printer."
