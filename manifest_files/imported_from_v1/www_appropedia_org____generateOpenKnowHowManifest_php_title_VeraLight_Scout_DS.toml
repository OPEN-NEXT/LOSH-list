function = "== Problem being addressed == Diabetes Mellitus is a growing world-wide problem. Half of the current cases in the developing world go undetected for 5-9 years after onset, leading to irreversible damage. Current diagnostic techniques are invasive and inconvenient due to weak test sensitivity and the need for drawing blood.   == Detailed description of the solution == The Scout DS is a completely non-invasive device used to detect pre-diabetes and type II diabetes in adults. The patient simply places his or her arm on a portable table device, which accurately measures skin biomarkers such as Advanced Glycation End Products, metabolic and microvascular changes."
