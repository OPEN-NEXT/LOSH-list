function = "Our idea is to create a self illuminating LED that is powered by ultravoilet and infrared light. The casing is the power source absorbing infrared and UV light, while remaining transparent to visible light.   == Benefits of 3D Printing ==   === General Benefits === 3D print allows for the construction of a nonuniform geometric shape to be constructed out of semiconductor material. Because the Lens Cap of a Diode is not plane construction it is necessary to develop a method that allows us to construct the lens from the bottom up. 3D printing allows for the creation of a \"pattern\" of semiconductor material within the conductive thermoplastic layer that is the primary constituent of the lens."
