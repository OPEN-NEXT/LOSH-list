function = "This vibrational dampener was designed to reduce the vibrational noise of the MOST Delta - Athena during printing. This is achieved by reducing the motor-end contact area with the table / desk and provides a \"spring\" like action. Most notable differences will be seen on non-rigid tables / desks.   == Design and Printing ==   === Design === OpenSCAD was utilized for all modeling operations. The MOST-Athena GitHub file repository is located here."
