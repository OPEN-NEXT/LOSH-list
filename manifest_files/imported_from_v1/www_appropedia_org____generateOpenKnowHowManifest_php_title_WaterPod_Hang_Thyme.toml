These communities would be self sustaining and nomadic; allowing for growing populations to thrive in a highly innovative and more sustainable manner.  As a way of inspiring innovation, the WaterPod contacted the Environmental Resources Engineering Department at Humboldt State University in order to have their Engr215 students design highly sustainable tools to be utilized on the pod.   == Abstract ==  The Waterpod was created to demonstrate alternative living models for future living through water based communities.
