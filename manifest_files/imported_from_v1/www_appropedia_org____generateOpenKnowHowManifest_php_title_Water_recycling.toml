Water recycling and reuse is a tool that can reduce the need for dams and other traditional water supply infrastructure. Recycled water derives from residential and commercial wastewater that has been treated to produce a high-quality source of water.[1] Instead of this wastewater being dumped into rivers, it receives a high level of treatment and is put directly back to use in the system."
