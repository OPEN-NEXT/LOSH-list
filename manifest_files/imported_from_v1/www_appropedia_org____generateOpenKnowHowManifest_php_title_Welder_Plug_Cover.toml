function = "I currently have a job lined up with a welding company as a Mechanical Engineer upon graduation and thought about how male electrical receptacles were treated. Female ends/outlets for welders already have covers for their receptacles. When a plug gets wet or dirty, the operator typically blows it off; this plug cover mitigates the causes for this need. This cover is for a NEMA 6-50 plug.   == Bill of Materials == Any filament works A 3D printer A computer Open source file, stl, and used g.code can be found on YouMagine   == Tools needed == MOST Delta RepRap or similar RepRap 3-D printer   == Skills and knowledge needed == Basic 3D printer knowledge Basic slicer knowledge   == Technical Specifications and Assembly Instructions == Download STL, or customize a new model and download Slice STL file in slicer of choice (10% infill should be sufficient) Print part (print time is about 1.5 hours) Insert NEMA 6-50 male plug into printed plug cover   == Common Problems and Solutions == The main issue would be from tolerances."
