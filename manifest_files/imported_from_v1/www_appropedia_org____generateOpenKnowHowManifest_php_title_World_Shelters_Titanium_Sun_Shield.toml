function = "Titanium Sun shield is a primer and topcoat application over the polypropylene exterior of a WorldShelters temporary structure. The plastic sheeting makes adhesion difficult, so a primer is used and the purpose of applying a topcoat is to protect the plastic from ultraviolet radiation.   == Background == World Shelters is a not-for-profit volunteer organization that designs, manufactures, delivers, and assembles temporary shelters for both emergency and long-term humanitarian needs. The shelters are made of corrugated polypropylene sheets that are safe, durable and simple to transport and assemble. The structures last an average of three years, as ultraviolet radiation from the sun degrades the polypropylene."
