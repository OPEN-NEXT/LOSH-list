function = "== Problem being addressed == Multiple drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is an increasing problem.  Drug resistance occurs as a result of the incomplete or incorrect use of antibiotics in the treatment of patients with tuberculosis.  In order to increase compliance with tuberculosis drug regimens and improve outcomes in developing countries, X-Out TB uses SMS technology to keep track of treatment regimens.   == Detailed description of the solution == X-Out TB provides tuberculosis patients with a monthly supply of urinalysis test strips that are released from a dispenser every 24 hours.  The strips have four printed numbers and chemicals that change color when reacting with the urine of a patient who has been taking his or her medication."
