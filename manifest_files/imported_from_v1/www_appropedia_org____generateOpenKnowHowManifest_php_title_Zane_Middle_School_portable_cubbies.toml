function = "== Abstract ==  The objective of Team Tonalites was to construct a set of cubbies for a Catherine L. Zane Middle School teacher to help promote safety in the classroom by creating space for students to place their belongings. The most important part of building the cubbies is making sure they are safe. Each cubby has to be portable to extend the capability of their usage. There are a total of 32 cubbies built. They are made out of medium density fiber board and held together with screws and wood glue."
