function = "== Abstract ==  Our team, Porta Possibilities, consists of four Humboldt State University Environmental Resources Engineering students. For our Engr215 Introduction to Design class, Merissa Coello, Brent Davis, Isaiah Duarte and Erin Mcdannold were given the opportunity to work with a local school, Zane Middle School, and improve their process of recycling. Our project was to improve the process that was currently in place of cleaning the recyclables from the school's cafeteria.   == Background ==  Zane Middle School in Eureka California is working to reduce the amount of waste produced daily through  recycling. As a part of this effort, staff have worked out a deal with Eel River Recycling to recycle milk cartons, a product that is not typically or easily recycled."
