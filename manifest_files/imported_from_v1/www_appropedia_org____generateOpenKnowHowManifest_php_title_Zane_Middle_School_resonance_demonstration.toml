function = "== Background & Objective ==  The objective of this project is to design a resonance demonstration unit for the students at Zane Middle School. The demonstration unit is being built for the 7th grade Engineering and Science teacher Ken Pinkerton. Mr. Pinkerton currently lacks a demonstration unit that conveys the idea of resonance which is why the Resonauts have chosen this project. As a group, the design team call themselves the Resonauts."
