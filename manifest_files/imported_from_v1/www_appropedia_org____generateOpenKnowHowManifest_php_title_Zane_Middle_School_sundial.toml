Our project team is called Division by Zero. Team members include Hannah Gidanian, Caitlin Gundert, Rick Thomas, and Alex Watson. The front of Zane Middle School features a large rectangle filled with bark mulch, 10 feet wide and over 100 feet long. This empty space receives a large amount of uninterrupted sun throughout the day."
