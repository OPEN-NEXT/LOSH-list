function = "The purpose of this project is to create up-cycled benches used for sitting purposes, campus beautification, and for educating both students and faculty about the recyclable use of material waste in the community. While many options were considered for building the benches, street signs and a metal frame were decided upon for aesthetic reasons and that they would be up-cycled. The resulting benches are made of galvanized steel plumbing pipes and up-cycled street signs. The benches are comfortable, functional, and educational.   == Background == Catherine L. Zane Middle School in Eureka, CA, is the client entity for the up-cycled benches."
