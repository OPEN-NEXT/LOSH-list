title: List of OSH Platforms
...

# Platforms

## Arduino Project Hub

<https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub>

- arduino projects only

## Git-based Platforms

## general

- git allows for consistent versioning (standard tool for FOSS, become a standard for OSH)
- (reference to Jérémy's paper comparing git to other platforms)
- command-line tool with loads of different GUIs and CLIs available
- git-based platforms (usually) allow for automatic jobs that run over your data; e.g. the [OSH-Tool](https://gitlab.com/OSEGermany/osh-tool) checking your repository for errors after each change or [MoVeDo](https://github.com/movedo/MoVeDo) creating e.g. PDF exports for your Markdown documents.

BUT:

- may be challenging to learn if you never had been in touch with version control systems before (which is a pity)
- doesn't work too well with binaries (e.g. most CAD files); however, 1) _no_ version control system works very well with binaries and 2) there are workarounds for that (e.g. [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/))

### GitHub

- the most popular git-based platform
- owned my Microsoft

### GitLab

- the most popular open source git-based platform
- larger communities sometimes choose to host their own GitLab instance\
    e.g. [CERN](https://home.cern/) hosts its OSH projects on the it's own GitLab instance, called the Open Hardware Repository (<https://ohwr.org/>).

### GitTea

- simplest git-based platform, ideal for git-beginners

## Hackster

<https://www.hackster.io/>

## Instructables

<https://www.instructables.com/>

- mostly DIY
- lots of 3D-printed projects

## Kitspace

<https://kitspace.org/>

- electronics
- PCBs can be ordered by linked 3rd parties
- GitHub/GitLab importer: upload files directly via repository URL
- direct contact to the maintainer of kitspace possible e.g. via Elements or IRC

## OpenHardware

<https://www.openhardware.io/>

- electronics
- PCBs can be ordered by linked 3rd parties
- GitHub importer: upload files directly via repository URL

## Open Hardware Observatory
